# WP3 â€“ Data Collection

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.10655098.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10655098)


This repository collects the data assembled in WP3 - Data Collection. This activity is part of the Horizon EU project MODERATE (https://moderate-project.eu/).

The scope of WP3 is to assemble and organise data and information for the MODERATE platform. The WP is subdivided in two main tasks:

- **Task 3.1 - Top-down approach: Dynamic building stock analysis.** The purpose of this task is to explore opportunities for combining dynamic data coming from satellite and/or sensors in buildings to obtain information on the status of the building stock both in terms of characteristics and energy consumption.
- **Task 3.2 - Bottom-up approach: Static building stock analysis.** The purpose of this task is to collect data regarding the EU27 building stock (reference year 2020) at NUTS0 level.
- **Task 3.4 - Comparison of dynamic and static data.** The purpose of this task is to compare data obtained from top-down and bottom-up approaches.


### Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follow:

- `T3.1-dynamic-analysis/` directory collecting the code and results of Task 3.1 - Top-down approach: Dynamic building stock analysis
- `T3.2-static-analysis/` directory collecting the code and results of Task 3.2 - Bottom-up approach: Static building stock analysis
- ` T3.4-PV-identification/` directory collecting the code and results of Task 3.4 - Comparison of dynamic and static data
