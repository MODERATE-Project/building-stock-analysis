# Task 3.1 - Top-down approach: Dynamic building stock analysis

This directory collects the data assembled in *“Task 3.1 - Top-down approach: Dynamic building stock analysis”*.

The scope of Task 3.1 is to explore opportunities for combining dynamic data coming from satellite and/or sensors in buildings to obtain information on the status of the building stock both in terms of characteristics and energy consumption.

Task 3.1 is formed my three case studies:

- **Case Study I: EPCs Classification form Satellite Images.** We proposed a method for automatically classifying building energy performance certificates based on the analysis of satellite images.
- **Case Study II: Photovoltaic Data Extraction from Aerial Imagery.** We presented an approach based on aerial images to detect installed photovoltaic panels and estimate the installed photovoltaic capacity on rooftops in urban areas.
- **Case Study III: Analysis Photovoltaic Distribution in Relation to Urban Morphology from Aerial Imagery.** We investigated the relationship between urban residential and industrial areas with respect to presence of PV installations. 


### Directory Structure

The directory is structured as follow:

- `Case-study-I-EPCs-classification/` directory collecting the code and results of case study I.
- `Case-study-II-III-PV-analysis/` directory collecting the code and results of case study II and III.
