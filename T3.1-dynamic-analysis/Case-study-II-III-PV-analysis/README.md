# Case Study II and III

In *“Case Study II: Photovoltaic Data Extraction from Aerial Imagery”*, we presented an approach based on aerial images to detect installed photovoltaic panels and estimate the installed photovoltaic capacity on rooftops in urban areas.

In *“Case Study III: Analysis Photovoltaic Distribution in Relation to Urban Morphology from Aerial Imagery”*, we investigated the relationship between urban residential and industrial areas with respect to presence of PV installations. 

## Data Sources

To obtain the processed data used in the analysis, the following data sources were used:

- The aerial imagery used in this project is freely available as open data and has been retrieved from the portal of IDEV [Infraestructura Valenciana de Dades Espacials](https://geocataleg.gva.es/#/search?uuid=spaicv0202_2022CVAL0025&lang=spa). 

    The imagery consists of orthophotos in natural color (red, green, and blue - RGB) and false infrared color (IRG) covering the extent of the Comunidad Valenciana at a resolution of 25 centimeters per pixel. The images are based on a RGBI digital photogrammetric flight and were taken from 08/05/2022 to 11/06/2022. The data was downloaded in the form of six 1:5.000 sheets in a TIFF format which were then patched as a unique image in a GIS environment.  

- Bottom-up data on photovoltaic installations in Crevillent have been provided by Enercoop, the energy cooperative managing the electricity network of the town. The data was in the form of a list of 98 addresses with photovoltaic installations as of 2022 and the relative installed inverter capacity expressed in Watts. 

 
Data have been elaborated as described in *“Deliverable 3.1: Dynamic Building Stock Analysis”*. 
The obtained final dataset used in the analysis is `MODERATE-D3.1-Dataset2_3.csv`.

## Data Description
 
`MODERATE-D3.1-Dataset2_3.csv` is the output of the study containing information regarding rooftop photovoltaic presence in Crevillent, Spain. The dataset includes the following columns:

- `id_building`. Factor variable indicating the id number of each detected building.
- `h`. Numerical variable indicating the height [m] of each specific building.
- `Roof area`.  Numerical variable indicating the roof area [m2] of each specific building.
- `municipio`. Binomial variable where 1 indicates the presence of the building within the municipality.
- `id_landuse`. Factor variable indicating the id number of the area of Crevillent in which the building is located.
- `Name`. Factor variable indicating the name of the area of Crevillent in which the building is located.
- `Land Use`. Factor variable indicating the whether the land use of the area of Crevillent in wh`ich the building is located is industrial or residential.
- `Id_pv`. Factor variable indicating the id number of the PV installation.
- `pv_area_m2`. Numerical variable indicating the surface area [m2] of each specific pv installation.
- `pv_presence`. Binomial variable indicating the presence of pv installations.
